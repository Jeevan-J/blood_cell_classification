# Blood Cell Counting and Classification
* RBC count
* WBC count
* WBC classification
* disease diagnosis<br />
### Summary
With the recent advancements in Image processing techniques and Machine learning, applying these to Biomedical images sees a enormous number of applications.
* Once such idea is to improve the time taken to produce the results of the red blood cell count by using image processing techniques rather than the manual counting done in the hospitals (around one to two hours in hospital)by using the blood smear images. <br>
* This project aslo aims to classify the white blood cells which would be very useful to identify any diseases present in the blood and thereby reducing the response time and hence a better treatment. 

### Present Work
* This work is presently continued and improved by <b>Jeevan Jamakayala</b>, IIT Tirupati.<br />
* Since this work is presently ongoing, improvements and updates will be made though time.
